### Kele API Client
----

A Ruby Gem API client to access the Bloc API, providing easy access to and use of [the student endpoints of Bloc's API](http://docs.blocapi.apiary.io/). Students can get their user and enrollment info, check their mentorâ€™s availability, see their course roadmaps, and even submit their assignments through the command line. This Gem also offers the ability to read, send, and receive messages. All data is parsed and neatly formatted into JSON for easy readability.
